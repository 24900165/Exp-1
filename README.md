# Exp-1 ATM & BANKING SYSTEM

# AIM:
To study the problem statement, SRS document and draw all the UML diagrams of ATM System.

# SRS (Procedure):
1. **Problem Identification** – Find the purpose and need of the system.
2. **Requirement Gathering** – Collect user and bank requirements.
3. **System Analysis** – Study existing systems and identify improvements.
4. **System Design** – Plan system architecture and data flow.
5. **Functional Specification** – Define what the system should do (withdraw, deposit, transfer, etc.).
6. **Non-Functional Specification** – Define performance, security, and reliability needs.
7. **Testing & Validation** – Check if the system meets all requirements.
8. **Documentation & Maintenance** – Prepare reports and update the system as needed.
